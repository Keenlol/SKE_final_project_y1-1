## Features ‚ú®

- **2 Player Action**: Classic head-to-head Pong gameplay.  
- **Paddle Tilting**: Tilt paddles clockwise or counterclockwise for tricky shots.  
- **Multiple Balls**: Experience the chaos of multiple balls which respawns at the center when leaving the field.
- **Speedy Balls**: Ball speed increase everytime it hits the Paddle.
- **Customization Options**: before the game starts you'll get to
  - Choose paddle colors for each player.  
  - Set player names to personalize the game.  
  - Define the winning score.  
- **Stats & Rematch**:  
  - Displays scores and player names during gameplay.  
  - Includes a **Rematch** button when a player wins.  
- **Dynamic Ball Colors**: Ball colors change based on kinetic energy to shift player's focus to danger!  
- **Paddle animation**: Smooth dynamic animation (using math!!!) for paddle's movement and rotation.

## Classes and Diagrams üìà

### Class Overview
- `PongPlus` : The game loops and is the central class of the game.
- `Ball` : All things ball!, position, mass, size, appearance, collision physics, collision prediction.
- `Event` : The event of the game. storing necessary data for each event. Use to queue up all the game activity.
- `Paddle` : The paddle, its angle, position, and appearance.
  - `Player` : The player, control their paddles, their scores and names.
- `Char` : Handles the display of a **sigle** alphanumeric character.
- `Text` : Handles the display of **multiple** alphanumeric character using the `Char` class.
  - `Button` : Clickable Text that do something.

## Project sophistication level ‚≠ê

### 95
- An event-based game involving multiple ball objects colliding with one another and with multiple surfaces, one of which is a control-able and tilt-able paddles that can be oriented at an angle.
- The paddle has an animation using math instead of pre-coding it frame by frame.
- The ball linearly changes the color according to its kinetic energy by following a set of color as a gradient.
- A custom fonts drawn purely with turtle in which its height, width and spacing can be easily adjusted if needed to.
- Includes an ending screen with a button that can restart the game as much as desired.

## Project design and implementation üíª

-  As for the paddles, from **Aj.Paruj**'s code which only detects and calculate collision from the top and bottom of the paddle. I added collisions detection and calculation from the side of the paddle.
-  As for calculating the collisions for tilting paddles, I rotate everything around the middle of the paddle and pretend like the paddle is up right, so that I can reuse the code for the not-tilted paddles. I created a helper function that rotate an (x, y) position around a certain pivot and that allows me to rotate the ball's position and velocity vectors around the paddle so that I can easily calculate it and rotate it back to apply the correct values.
-  Paddles animation where made by having a target location and then set the current position x% the distance between the current position and the target position so you have this kinda of nice *easing out* animation.
-  The ball's mass is calculated based on its size. Its color dynamically changes according to its kinetic energy, transitioning along a gradient from light blue (`rgb(200, 230, 255)`) at low speeds to bright red (`rgb(230, 20, 20)`) at high speeds. This helps players focus on the most dangerous ball amid the chaos.
-  I added an extra class for displaying characters using turtle, which is basically a 3x3 grid which each point having its own id:
```
points:
0  1  2
3  4  5
6  7  8
```
- I can draw any character based this grid which the distance between each point can be adjusted by the given character width, height and spacing. I can draw characters it based on certain sequences such as...
  - `[0, 2, 8, 6]` for "0"
  - `[6, 3, 1, 5, 8, 5, 3]` for "A"
  - `[]` for " " (space)
  - 
- I also add the "REMATCH" button to replay the game.
- I use tkinter (which is module that turtle use to display stuff) to pop up prompts for the customization of the game which includes player names, number of balls, and paddle colors that player can pick.

## Known Issues üêû
- Collision Overlap: Paddles may occasionally ignore the ball if they overlap under specific movement scenarios. Increasing the event frequency or refining collision logic could address this issue.
- Window Flashes: Closing the game might briefly display flashing windows. This is a cosmetic issue with no functional impact.
